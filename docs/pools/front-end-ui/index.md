This section is dedicated to providing a detailed and comprehensive overview of the general features, components, and example sites that make up the defactor user interface.
Here, we will explore the general characteristics that define the technologies with which our components and user interfaces are developed.

Additionally, we'll delve deeper into the individual components that make up our pages. Each component has been designed and developed with a specific purpose in mind, applying atomic design pattern.

Last but not least, we will present several example sites that demonstrate how these components can be combined and used in practice. These examples serve as a valuable source of inspiration and guidance for those seeking to better understand how our user interface can be used to create effective and engaging user experiences.

We hope that this section of the technical documentation will be a valuable resource to better understand the Defactor front-end.
