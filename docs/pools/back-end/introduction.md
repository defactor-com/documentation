## Introduction

The **Pools Backend** includes a full set of APIs and SDK modules to interact with Defactorâ€™s lending infrastructure. These tools enable developers to integrate borrowing, lending, collateral management, and liquidation flows into their applications with ease.

This backend layer supports both **ERC-20 Collateral Pools** and **Counterparty Pools**, offering flexibility for open and permissioned lending models.

## API Access

The Pools backend exposes both **GraphQL** and **RESTful** APIs for integration with frontend dashboards, monitoring tools, or automation systems.

- [**GraphQL API**](api/engagegraphql.md)  
  Used for dynamic queries, metadata access, and state tracking  
  Supports real-time access to pool configuration, transactions, and statuses

- [**RESTful API**](api/engagerestful.md)  
  Ideal for server-side operations, triggering actions, and syncing data  
  Useful for managing interactions with smart contracts and orchestrating workflows

Additional APIs exist for:

- [**Counterparty Pools**](api/counterpartyPools/restful.md)
- [**ERC-20 Collateral Pools**](api/erc20CollateralToken/restful.md)
- [**IPFS Integration**](api/ipfs/restful.md) (for off-chain metadata)

## SDK Modules

For direct integration into JavaScript/TypeScript environments, the Pools SDK provides ready-to-use modules with contract wrappers and utility functions.

- [**Collateral Pool SDK**](sdk/collateral-pool.md)  
  Manage ERC-20 token collateralization, borrowing, repayment, and reward logic

- [**Counterparty Pool SDK**](sdk/counterparty-pool.md)  
  Handle lender/borrower matching, custom loan terms, and permissioned flows

These SDKs abstract low-level contract interactions and provide utilities for gas estimation, transaction formatting, and wallet connection.

## Key Capabilities

- Create and manage lending pools
- Borrow and lend using on-chain collateral
- Monitor loan status, interest accrual, and repayment
- Handle automatic liquidations and risk triggers
- Integrate with wallet providers and frontends

## Getting Started

1. Choose your integration type: [API](api/engagerestful.md) or [SDK](sdk/collateral-pool.md)
2. Connect your Web3 wallet or backend provider
3. Start building lending, borrowing, and liquidity flows
