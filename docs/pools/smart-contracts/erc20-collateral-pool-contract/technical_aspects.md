## Contract Modules

- **ERC20CollateralPool.sol**: Main contract.
- **ERC20CollateralPool.interface.sol**: Interface for contract structures and events.
- **ERC20CollateralPool.storage.sol**: Storage contract for state management.
- **AggregatorV3Interface.sol**: Interface for Chainlink price feeds.

## Key Components

### Constants

- `LIQUIDATION_PROTOCOL_FEE`: Fixed fee for liquidation.
- `LIQUIDATION_FEE`: Additional liquidation fee.
- `OZ_IN_G`: Ounces to grams conversion constant.
- `ONE_YEAR`: One year in seconds.
- `HOUNDRED`: Constant for percentage calculations.

### Initialization

- `__ERC20CollateralPool_init`: Initialize the contract with admin, USDC token, and pools.

### Pool Management

- `addPool`: Add a new pool.
- `announceEditPool`: Announce upcoming pool edits.
- `commitEditPool`: Commit announced pool edits.
- `cancelEditPool`: Cancel announced pool edits.

### Contract Control

- `pause` / `unpause`: Pause or unpause contract operations.

### User Interactions

- `lend`: Lend USDC to a pool.
- `borrow`: Borrow USDC against collateral.
- `repay`: Repay borrowed USDC with interest.
