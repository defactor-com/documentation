The **Buyback** section in the Engage Admin Panel gives project teams visibility into all token buyback operations. Token buybacks are an essential part of Defactor’s circular token economy — used to reduce circulating supply, support token value, and return value to the ecosystem.

## Buyback Wallets

**Buyback wallets** are specific blockchain wallet addresses used within the **Engage platform** to carry out and manage **token buybacks**.

Here’s a breakdown of what they are, how they work, and why they matter:

### What are Buyback Wallets?

Buyback wallets are designated treasury or contract-controlled wallets used to:

1. Receive protocol revenue (typically in USDC or other stablecoins).
2. Trigger token buybacks on the open market.
3. Lock repurchased tokens for a fixed period (e.g., 12 months).
4. Track and report buyback activity in the Engage dashboard.

### How they work in Engage?

1. **Revenue Collection**

    Fees from toolkit usage (Assets, Engage, Pools) are funneled into the buyback wallet.

2. **Conversion & Purchase**

    The wallet's funds are used to purchase tokens (e.g. $FACTR) on the open market via a DEX (like Uniswap).

3. **Token Lockup**

    Purchased tokens are transferred to a lock or vesting wallet and are unavailable for circulation during the lockup period.

4. **Auditability**

    All buyback wallet transactions are logged and made visible through the Buyback section in Engage for transparency. -->
