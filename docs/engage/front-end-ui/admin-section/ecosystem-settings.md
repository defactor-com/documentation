The **Ecosystem** section in the Engage Admin Panel offers a transparent overview of all wallet addresses, token flows, and allocations within your projectâ€™s ecosystem. This section allows administrators to ensure financial clarity and trust by clearly showing how project tokens are held, used, and distributed.

### Overview of the Ecosystem Section?

This section centralizes all wallet-related information and real-time analytics for your token ecosystem. It acts as a **public ledger and admin ledger** that showcases:

- The full list of official project wallets
- Roles and designations (e.g., Treasury, Rewards, Team, Liquidity)
- Wallet balances (current and historical)
- Token distribution breakdowns

## Understanding the Allocation graphic

The Allocation Graphic in the Ecosystem section visually represents how your projectâ€™s token supply is distributed across key stakeholder categories and functions. It provides a real-time, visual summary of tokenomics in action.

### Allocated Tokens

Allocated tokens refer to the portion of your total token supply that has been assigned to specific purposes or wallets, typically in line with your tokenomics framework.

These include:

- Tokens granted to team, advisors, or investors (whether distributed or still vesting)
- Tokens set aside for ecosystem programs like staking, grants, or liquidity
- Tokens locked for governance or future use
- Any token allocation recorded in the Allocation or Vesting modules

> ðŸ”’ *Allocated does not mean distributed â€” it simply means the tokens have been earmarked and accounted for, even if they are still locked or vesting.*


### Unallocated Tokens

Unallocated tokens are the portion of the supply that remains **unassigned**, meaning they havenâ€™t been:

- Allocated to any wallet
- Scheduled for vesting
- Committed to any functional use (liquidity, treasury, etc.)

These are typically held in reserve by the projectâ€™s treasury and can be used for:

- Future hires or contributors
- Strategic partnerships or fundraising
- DAO-governed grants or proposals
- Emergency reserves or burns

> ðŸ§  *Keeping a portion unallocated is common in early or growing ecosystems to maintain flexibility and optionality.*

## Ecosystem Addresses

Each project-owned wallet is displayed in the Ecosystem section with:

- **Wallet address**
- **Balance of $FACTR or other project tokens**
- **Custom label** for its purpose (e.g., "Staking Rewards", "Liquidity Provision", "Vesting Treasury")
- **Network location** (Ethereum, Polygon, Base, etc.)

### Wallet Types May Include:

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Treasury | Core reserve for future operations or emissions |
| Team | Wallets used for team vesting and compensation |
| Liquidity | Used to provide liquidity on DEXs |
| Rewards | Used for staking, bounties, or community incentives |
| Development | Internal Dev or DAO infrastructure budgets |

### Add Ecosystem Addresses

The **Add Ecosystem Addresses** flow in the Engage Admin Panel allows project administrators to register new wallet addresses that belong to the project. These wallets will be monitored and categorized as part of your token ecosystem.

### Why Add Ecosystem Addresses?

Adding project wallets to the Ecosystem section allows Engage to:

- Display token balances for each wallet in real time
- Attribute wallet activity (e.g., staking, rewards, treasury) to specific categories
- Populate the Allocation and Token Distribution charts with verified data
- Ensure full visibility and traceability for audits and community reporting

### How to Add a New Ecosystem Wallet

1. Click the **â€œAdd Wallet** button at the top of the wallet list.
