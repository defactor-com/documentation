## Welcome to the General Section of the Engage Admin Panel!
This section provides core functionalities for monitoring, managing, and ensuring transparency across your project's token ecosystem.

---

## Overview of the General Section

The General section of the Engage Admin Panel serves as the operational cockpit for administrators, offering a centralized view of all essential token economy data and ecosystem management. It is designed to help you oversee and manage your token ecosystem with precision and transparency.

- Token supply and distribution

- Ecosystem wallet management

This section ensures administrators can track and optimize all token-related operations from a single dashboard.

## Admin Accounts

The **Admin Accounts** section in the Engage Admin panel allows designated project owners to manage who has administrative access to Engage's powerful governance and token management capabilities. This ensures only authorized individuals can execute sensitive actions like launching proposals, modifying pools, and updating vesting entries.


**What Are Admin Accounts?**

Admin Accounts are wallet addresses with elevated permissions on the Engage platform. These addresses can:

- Access restricted dashboard views
- Create or update staking pools
- Manage vesting schedules
- Submit and moderate governance proposals
- Configure token parameters
- View sensitive analytics or manage compliance

Only wallets listed as admins can see and use the admin interface.

**Admin Account Use Cases**

- Launching governance votes for protocol upgrades
- Configuring new token vesting schedules for partners or contributors
- Adjusting pool parameters after community feedback
- Registering new tokens or networks with compliance rules

Admin accounts are critical to the governance and operational lifecycle of a token-powered ecosystem.

### Adding or Removing Admins

To update admin access:

1. Navigate to the **Admin Section > General > Admin Accounts** section.
2. You will see a table of current admin wallet addresses.
3. Click **“Add Admin”** and input a valid wallet address.
4. Confirm the action via your connected wallet.

To remove an admin:
- Click the trash icon next to their address.
- Confirm the wallet signature to complete removal.

> 🛡️ *Only the primary contract owner or governance-approved multisig can update admin privileges.*


**Best Practices for Admin Account Management**

- Use **hardware wallets** for admin roles to reduce the risk of key compromise.
- Assign admin privileges based on roles (e.g., staking manager, vesting manager).
- Regularly review the admin list and remove inactive accounts.
- For DAOs, rotate admin keys or multisig signers in sync with governance cycles.

<!-- ## Manage Tokens

The **Manage Tokens** section of the Engage Admin Panel enables administrators to control and configure all project tokens that are integrated with the Engage platform. This includes basic metadata setup, network mapping, regulatory settings (e.g., KYC/AML enforcement), and compatibility for use in staking, governance, or collateralization.

---

## Overview

Managing tokens is a core function of ecosystem administration. Whether your project supports utility tokens like **$FACTR** or regulatory-compliant tokens such as **ERC-3643 assets**, this section ensures they are properly configured for cross-platform usage and transparency.

---

### Adding a New Token

To register a new token on Engage:

1. Go to **Admin > General > Manage Tokens**
2. Click **“Add Token”**
3. Fill in the following details:
   - **Token Contract Address**
   - **Token Name**
   - **Token Symbol**
   - **Token Logo URL**
   - **Price Source** (The Manual Price checkbox lets the user manually input a price if the token is not listed in Coingecko.)

> ☑️ Engage automatically verifies the token’s contract metadata and checks its validity on-chain.

---

## Editing or Removing Tokens

To modify a token:
- Click the **Edit** icon next to the token.
- Update Logo URL and/or Price Source.
- Click on **Save Changes**

To remove a token:
- Click the **Remove** icon.
- Confirm the action through your connected wallet. 

> ⚠️ Token removal will disable its use in staking, proposals, and dashboards. It does not affect previously issued tokens.
---

## Best Practices

- Verify all contract addresses carefully — incorrect inputs may misrepresent your token.
- Periodically review token usage across modules (staking, ART, governance).
- Apply compliance controls for regulated assets to ensure legal consistency.
- Use clear naming and labeling conventions for easier wallet UX.
