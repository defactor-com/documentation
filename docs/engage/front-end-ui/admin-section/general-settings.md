## Welcome to the General Section of the Engage Admin Panel!
This section provides core functionalities for monitoring, managing, and ensuring transparency across your project's token ecosystem.

---

## Overview of the General Section

The **General** section acts as the operational cockpit for project administrators, giving a birdâ€™s eye view of:

- Token supply and distribution

- Ecosystem wallet activity

- Staking metrics

- Governance participation

- Buyback activities

This section ensures administrators can track, audit, and optimize all token-related operations from a single dashboard.

## Project Token Information

Admins gain real-time access to essential token metrics:

- Circulating Supply: The live number of tokens actively available in the market.
- Total Supply: The overall maximum number of tokens minted.
- Network Distribution: Breakdown of tokens across different blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, Base, BNB Chain, Algorand).
- Buybacks Completed: The cumulative number of tokens repurchased from the market via automated buyback programs.
- Staked Tokens: The volume of tokens currently locked into staking pools.

> *Tip: Use this section to monitor the project's health and growth based on staking and buyback dynamics.*

## Ecosystem Wallet Management

The General Section provides full visibility into project-owned wallets:

- Wallet Addresses: View all official project-controlled wallets.
- Live Balances: Instantly see the amount of tokens (and other assets) held.
- Historical Balances: Track wallet balance trends over time for financial audits or transparency reporting.

> Hovering over the info icon ("i") next to each wallet address provides a brief description of its role (e.g., Treasury, Operations, Liquidity Pool, etc.)
