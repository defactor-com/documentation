## Admin Accounts

The **Admin Accounts** section in the Engage Admin panel allows designated project owners to manage who has administrative access to Engage's powerful governance and token management capabilities. This ensures only authorized individuals can execute sensitive actions like launching proposals, modifying pools, and updating vesting entries.


**What Are Admin Accounts?**

Admin Accounts are wallet addresses with elevated permissions on the Engage platform. These addresses can:

- Access restricted dashboard views
- Create or update staking pools
- Manage vesting schedules
- Submit and moderate governance proposals
- Configure token parameters
- View sensitive analytics or manage compliance

Only wallets listed as admins can see and use the admin interface.


### Adding or Removing Admins

To update admin access:

1. Navigate to the **Admin > Accounts** section.
2. You will see a table of current admin wallet addresses.
3. Click **‚ÄúAdd New Admin‚Äù** and input a valid wallet address.
4. Confirm the action via your connected wallet.

To remove an admin:
- Click the trash icon next to their address.
- Confirm the wallet signature to complete removal.

> üõ°Ô∏è *Only the primary contract owner or governance-approved multisig can update admin privileges.*


**Best Practices for Admin Account Management**

- Use **hardware wallets** for admin roles to reduce the risk of key compromise.
- Assign admin privileges based on roles (e.g., staking manager, vesting manager).
- Regularly review the admin list and remove inactive accounts.
- For DAOs, rotate admin keys or multisig signers in sync with governance cycles.


**Admin Account Use Cases**

- Launching governance votes for protocol upgrades
- Configuring new token vesting schedules for partners or contributors
- Adjusting pool parameters after community feedback
- Registering new tokens or networks with compliance rules

Admin accounts are critical to the governance and operational lifecycle of a token-powered ecosystem.
