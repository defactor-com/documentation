The staking module within Engage empowers users to lock their $FACTR tokens in staking pools and earn rewards while contributing to the security and governance of the ecosystem.

## Key Features

## How Staking Works

1. **Connect Wallet** – Ensure your wallet is connected to the correct chain (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.).
2. **Select Pool** – Choose a staking pool that matches your desired duration and yield.
3. **Stake Tokens** – Enter the number of $FACTR tokens and confirm the transaction.
4. **Earn Rewards** – View accrued rewards in real time.
5. **Claim or Unstake** – Once the lockup period ends, click 'Unstake & Claim' or 'Claim' to receive rewards.

## Dashboard Elements
