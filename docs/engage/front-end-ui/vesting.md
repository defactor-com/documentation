The Vesting module enables time-based, structured distribution of tokens according to predefined schedules. It is typically used to manage allocations for contributors, investors, core team members, and ecosystem participants, ensuring long-term alignment with project objectives and token supply discipline.

By enforcing lock-up periods and gradual token release, the vesting mechanism helps mitigate premature sell-offs, build trust with stakeholders, and enhance transparency across token allocations. Vesting plans can vary in complexity and duration and are fully trackable through the Engage platform.

The module is compatible with any ERC-20 token and supports a wide range of vesting scenarios, including linear, cliff-based, or milestone-driven schedules.

A live example of the module in action can be accessed via the [Engage Platform Demo](https://sharingblock-engage.defactor.dev/vesting).
