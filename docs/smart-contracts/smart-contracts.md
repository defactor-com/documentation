# Defactor Smart Contracts

Here lies the core of our blockchain operations â€” the smart contract code. Our Algorand contracts are crafted in PyTeal, offering a Pythonic approach to Teal contracts. Ethereum and Polygon smart contracts are developed in Solidity, the industry standard for Ethereum-based contracts.

### ERC20CollateralPool

This contract is used to hold the collateral tokens for the `TXAU` and `TXAG` token contracts.

### Pools

This contract allow any user to create their own pool.
