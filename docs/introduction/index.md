- **Liquidity:** Tokenization can increase the liquidity of traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or art.
- **Accessibility:** Broadens the accessibility to investment opportunities, allowing fractional ownership.
- **Efficiency:** Streamlines processes, reducing the need for intermediaries and lowering transaction costs.
- **Transparency and Security:** Blockchain technology ensures transparent, secure, and tamper-proof record-keeping.
