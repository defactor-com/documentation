At Defactor, we employ a sophisticated technology stack to ensure our solutions are both powerful and resilient.

## Core Technologies

- **EVM Blockchain Integration**: We integrate with EVM-compatible blockchains, like Polygon, to provide secure and scalable decentralized applications.
- **React**: Leveraging this library, we build dynamic user interfaces for our web applications.
- **Hasura**: Offering a real-time GraphQL API over PostgreSQL, Hasura facilitates efficient data management with built-in authorization.
- **Hapi**: This framework enables us to construct versatile applications and services with a focus on reusability.
- **Node.js**: We utilize Node.js for its efficiency in building scalable network applications.
- **Docker**: Docker's containerization technology allows us to deliver software reliably.
- **Kubernetes**: We orchestrate our containerized applications with Kubernetes, enhancing deployment and scalability.

## Infrastructure Overview

</center>

## Web Application

Our web applications are crafted using [React.js](https://reactjs.org), [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) to ensure they are both robust and user-friendly.

### UI Kit

Our UI Kit is an open-source collection of React components designed for easy integration into Defactor front-ends. It ensures visual consistency across our tools and accelerates the development process. Access the UI Kit on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/defactor-com/ui-kit).

## Backend Architecture

### Defactor SDK

The Defactor SDK is an open-source Node.js module that standardizes backend development, promoting best practices as defined by our core team. It streamlines the creation of backend services. Visit the SDK [GitHub repository](https://github.com/defactor-com/sdk) for more details.

### Hasura GraphQL Server

Hasura enhances our PostgreSQL database operations with a robust GraphQL API, simplifying CRUD actions and supporting custom REST extensions for intricate business logic.

### Hapi REST Server

For custom RESTful needs, we rely on [hapi.dev](https://hapi.dev/) for its simplicity and efficiency in developing scalable server-side solutions.

## EVM Blockchain Integration

We harness the power of multiple Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchains, such as [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), to benefit from rapid transactions and minimal fees, providing a formidable foundation for our decentralized applications.

### EVM Compatible Blockchain Networks 

Defactor is building smart contracts to be deployed on  EVM compatible networks:

 - [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) 
 - [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) (Layer 2)
 - [BSC](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/bnb-smart-chain) (Binance Smart Chain)
 - [Base](https://www.base.org/) (Coinbase EVM Network)

## Kubernetes Cluster

Our Kubernetes infrastructure guarantees service availability and resilience by isolating modules, minimizing the risk of systemic failures and optimizing for our unique operational needs.
