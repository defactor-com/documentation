# Agile Development Workflow at Defactor

Defactor's Agile Development Workflow documentation provides an in-depth guide to our iterative and incremental approach to software development. This workflow emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and rapid releases to enhance project transparency and efficiency.

## Agile Principles at Defactor

Agile at Defactor is about:

- **Quick Wins**: Delivering small product increments for feedback and iteration.
- **Quality**: Rigorously testing each increment.
- **Time Management**: Using time-boxed sprints, usually two weeks long.
- **Scope Management**: Prioritizing work to deliver the most valuable features first.

Refer to the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) for foundational principles.

## Key Agile Roles

- **Product Owner**: Manages the product backlog and ensures product success.
- **Scrum Master**: Oversees the Agile process and removes impediments.
- **The Team**: Delivers high-quality work in collaboration.

The [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/) offers further insights into these roles.

## Agile Artifacts

- **Epic**: A large body of work that encompasses significant functionality.
- **Feature**: An enhancement that delivers value and aligns with an Epic.
- **User Story**: A requirement from the user's perspective.
- **Task**: The smallest work unit to achieve a user story.

## Release Planning Process

1. **Identify Features**: Define what is needed for upcoming releases.
2. **Analyze Features**: Research and create a feature list.
3. **Prioritize**: Order the backlog by business value.
4. **Define Features**: Clearly outline features with acceptance criteria.
5. **Plan Releases**: Schedule feature development.
6. **Map Execution**: Visualize the feature delivery timeline.

## Agile Framework and Ceremonies

- **Backlog Grooming**: Refine user stories and defects.
- **Sprint Planning**: Choose user stories for the sprint.
- **Daily Stand-Ups**: Update on progress and impediments.
- **Sprint Review**: Showcase completed work.
- **Retrospective**: Reflect to improve the next sprint.

## Sprint Ceremonies Detailed

### Sprint Review
- **Goal**: Validate sprint outcomes with Product Owner approval.
- **Participants**: Scrum Master, Product Owner, Scrum Team, Stakeholders.
- **When**: End of the sprint.

### Test Review
- **Goal**: Analyze defects and testing outcomes from the sprint.
- **Participants**: Scrum Master, Product Owner, Testers.
- **When**: After sprint completion.

### Retrospective
- **Goal**: Enhance team collaboration and sprint effectiveness.
- **Participants**: Scrum Master, Scrum Team, Product Owner.
- **When**: Last day of the sprint.

## Product Backlog Management

The Product Backlog is dynamically managed, reflecting priorities and incorporating lessons learned. It is used to sequence sprint work and track progress across releases.

## User Story Development

User stories are crafted to provide value, are independently testable, and are sized to be completed within a sprint. They follow the INVEST criteria and are continuously refined.

### Template for User Stories
- **Format**: As a `[role]`, I want `[action]` so that `[benefit]`.

## User Story Best Practices

1. **Complete Stories**: Deliver value in each sprint.
2. **Organized Work**: Enable demonstrable and testable stories.
3. **Story Decomposition**: Break down complex stories for sprint manageability.
4. **Independence**: Develop stand-alone stories to avoid upstream dependencies.
