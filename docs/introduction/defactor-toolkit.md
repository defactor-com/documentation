The Defactor software suite is composed of three main projects: **Assets**, **Pools**, and **Engage**. Each tool is designed to enhance the capabilities of businesses and developers in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape.

## Assets

The **Assets** tool is an advanced token creation platform that allows users to tokenize real-world assets, such as real estate and gold. This tool facilitates the division of high-value assets into smaller, tradable tokens, enhancing their liquidity and making them accessible to a wider range of investors.

**Key Features:**
- **Fractional Ownership:** Enables the division of assets into smaller units.
- **Increased Liquidity:** Transforms traditionally illiquid assets into tradeable tokens.
- **Blockchain Empowerment:** Utilizes blockchain technology for enhanced trust and compliance.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces intermediary costs and streamlines transactions.

## Pools

**Pools** is a lending and borrowing platform that enables the creation of liquidity pools using real-world assets (RWA) as collateral. This tool allows businesses to lock their assets and access liquidity in a decentralized manner.

**Key Features:**
- **Customizable Pools:** Offers unique domains and branding options for each pool.
- **Secure and Compliant:** Integrates with trusted operators and ensures precision through external audits.
- **Innovative Financial Models:** Supports a variety of financial operations including loans backed by tokenized assets.

## Engage

**Engage** is a community management tool designed to enhance the utility of tokens by providing comprehensive engagement and insight tools for token communities.

**Key Features:**
- **Community Empowerment:** Offers tools for token staking, voting, and governance.
- **Analytical Insights:** Provides analytics dashboards to keep the community informed.
- **Transaction-Based Fees:** Keeps overhead low by leveraging a transaction-based fee structure.

## Technical Implementation

The three projects can be deployed across several blockchain networks, ensuring versatility and broad application potential:

- [Ethereum](/docs/blockchain-and-web3/ethereum)
- [Polygon](/docs/blockchain-and-web3/polygon)
- Binance Smart Chain
- Base - Coinbase

All three projects share a common tech stack, enhancing consistency and efficiency across the platform. This includes:

- A unified [Frontend UI kit](/docs/front-end-ui/react-components) that ensures a cohesive user experience.
- A robust [SDK](http://localhost:3000/docs/category/sdk) that facilitates the integration and development of custom functionalities.

Together, these tools form a comprehensive suite that empowers businesses and developers to innovate within the DeFi ecosystem, providing solutions that are not only efficient but also scalable and secure.
