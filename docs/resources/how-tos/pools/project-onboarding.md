The following guide provides a list of resources needed to launch your own lending pools with [**Defactor Pools**](https://www.defactor.com/pools) for liquidity and funding.

### Domain Name
- Project name / description
- Domain DNS changes and verification

## Smart Contract
- Define [smart contract](https://defactor.dev/docs/category/smart-contracts/) type
  - [`Pools`](https://defactor.dev/docs/smart-contracts/pools-contract/smart-contract-erc20-collateral-pool), allows users to create, manage, and interact with funding pools using `ERC20`, `ERC721`, and `ERC1155` tokens as collaterals.
  - [`ERC20CollateralPool`](https://defactor.dev/docs/smart-contracts/pools-contract/smart-contract-erc20-collateral-pool), designed for EVM based blockchains, manages pools of collateralized loans using `ERC20` standard token.

- Define network deployment (Testnet for testing and Mainnet for live deployment) 
  - [Ethereum](https://defactor.dev/docs/blockchain-and-web3/ethereum)
  - [Polygon](https://defactor.dev/docs/blockchain-and-web3/polygon)
  - [Algorand](https://defactor.dev/docs/blockchain-and-web3/algorand) 
- Define a `ERC20` base token with a precision of 6 (e.g., usdc, euroc, etc.)
- Smart contract deployment and testing
- Private Key Management
- Auditing and security checks

## Backend Configuration and Deployment
- Server setup and configuration
  - The backend uses `CoinGecko API` to get the price of the collateral token in terms of the base token: For example, if the collateral token is `FACTR` it must be available in the API coin list, which is under the name `defactor`. 
  Also, the base token must be available in the currency list, for example for `usdc` the usd currency must be supported, because they have a 1:1 ratio.
  - Setup the contract, admin, and borrower addresses
- Database setup and management
- Integration with smart contracts and blockchain
- Security measures and data protection
- Deployment and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) setup

## Webapp Branding
### Logos
- Design and integration
  - SVG project logo
  - Social media preview image
  - Favicon

### Organization data

- Project name
- Project Description
- URL of the company logo 
- Website URL and X URL

### Color Scheme
- Define the color scheme of your project
  - The background color
  - The primary and secondary color with the following variants:
    - `main`: The main color of the webapp
    - `light`: A lighter color than `main`
    - `dark`: A darker color than `main`

### Fonts
- Selection and integration
- Branding consistency across all platforms and materials

## Deploy Frontend Instance
- Google Analytics Tracking Code
- Frontend CI / CD Configuration
  - Setup the contract, token, and collateral token addresses

## Set Up Pools
- URL with the token icon image
- Pool Name and Description for metadata
- Create Pools using the `erc20collateralpool` contract:
  - Via [RESTful API](https://defactor.dev/docs/back-end-api/pools/erc20CollateralToken/restful)
  - Via [GraphQL API](https://defactor.dev/docs/back-end-api/pools/erc20CollateralToken/graphql)
- Create pools using the `pools` contract:
  - Using the [insert pool endpoint](https://defactor.dev/docs/back-end-api/pools/insertPool).

## Testing
- Functional testing (features and functionalities work as expected)
- Integration testing (different parts of the project work together)
- User acceptance testing (real users test the project in a staged environment)
- Performance testing (appâ€™s performance under various conditions)
- Security testing (identification of vulnerabilities and fixing)

## Post-Deployment
- Monitoring tools setup (for performance, errors, and security)
- Feedback loop establishment for continuous improvement
- Marketing and outreach strategy implementation
- User support and documentation
