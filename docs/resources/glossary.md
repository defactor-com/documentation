A unit of measure for the amount of computational effort required to execute operations on the Ethereum network.

---

## **I**

### ICO (Initial Coin Offering)

A fundraising mechanism where new projects sell their underlying crypto tokens in exchange for early capital.

---

### Issue

In the context of programming and software development, an “issue” is a term used to describe a bug report, improvement, or feature requested by someone who is working on the project.

---

### IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

A protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.

---

## **J**
