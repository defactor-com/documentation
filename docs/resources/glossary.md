List of terms necessary to understand the contents of this guide.

## **A**


### ACL (Access Control List)

A traffic filter of a list of networks and correlated actions used to improve security. Block or allow users to access specific resources.

* * *

### API (Application Programming Interface)

Set of functions and procedures that allow the creation of applications that access the characteristics or data of an operating system, application or other specific service.

* * *

## **B**

### Blockchain
A distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. It stores information electronically in digital format and is known for its secure design, decentralization, and resistance to modification of its data.

* * *

### Block
The fundamental unit of a blockchain, which contains a collection of transactions that have been validated by the network and permanently recorded.

* * *

### Bitcoin
The first and most well-known cryptocurrency, operating on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. It was introduced in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.

* * *

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)
A property of a system that allows it to continue operating properly in the event of failures of some of its components. In the context of blockchain, this refers to the system's ability to resist the problems associated with the Byzantine Generals' Problem.

* * *

### BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal)
A design document for introducing features or information to Bitcoin. This is the standard way of communicating ideas since Bitcoin is a decentralized project.

* * *

### BaaS (Blockchain as a Service)
A cloud-based service that enables users to develop their own digital products by working with blockchain. These can include smart contracts, decentralized applications (DApps), or other services without the need to set up or manage the blockchain infrastructure.

* * *

### Bear Market
A market condition where prices are falling or are expected to fall. It often leads to a downward economic trend and is characterized by pessimism.

* * *

### Bull Market
A market condition where prices are rising or are expected to rise. This term is typically used in the context of financial markets and reflects an upward trend and investor confidence.

* * *

### Burned Tokens
Refers to tokens that have been permanently removed from circulation. This is typically done by sending the tokens to an unusable account or address. Token burning can be used as a tool for managing inflation or for other economic strategies within a cryptocurrency ecosystem.

* * *

### Bridge
In the context of blockchain, a bridge refers to a connection that allows the transfer of tokens or data between two different blockchain ecosystems.

* * *

### Block Explorer
An online tool to view all transactions, past and present, on the blockchain. It provides information about the blockchain's activity, including transaction histories and balances of addresses.

* * *


## **C**

### Consensus Algorithm
A process in blockchain networks used to achieve agreement on a single data value or a single state of the network among distributed processes or multi-agent systems.

* * *

### Cryptocurrency
A digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates independently of a central bank, often used in blockchain systems.

* * *

## **D**

### Decentralized Application (DApp)
An application that runs on a decentralized network, avoiding a single point of failure or control.

* * *

### Distributed Ledger
A consensus of replicated, shared, and synchronized digital data geographically spread across multiple sites, countries, or institutions.

* * *

## **E**

### Ethereum
An open-source blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).

* * *

### ERC-20
A standard for creating and issuing smart contract tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

* * *

## **F**

### Fork
In blockchain, a change or divergence in the protocol that creates two separate paths, either temporarily or permanently.

* * *

### Fiat
Traditional government-issued currency, such as dollars or euros, not backed by a physical commodity.

* * *

## **G**

### Gas (Blockchain)
A unit of measure for the amount of computational effort required to execute operations on the Ethereum network.

* * *

## **H**

### Hash Rate
A measure of computational power per second used in mining and processing transactions in a blockchain network.

* * *

## **I**

### ICO (Initial Coin Offering)
A fundraising mechanism where new projects sell their underlying crypto tokens in exchange for early capital.

* * *

### IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
A protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.

* * *

## **J**

### JSON-RPC
A remote procedure call protocol encoded in JSON, used to interact with nodes in a blockchain network.

* * *

## **K**

### KYC (Know Your Customer)
The process of a business verifying the identity of its clients, commonly used in the context of financial institutions.

* * *

## **L**

### Layer 2
A secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain system, designed to solve its scalability and speed issues.

* * *

### Ledger
A record of transactions maintained by a blockchain network, which is distributed and immutable.

* * *

## **M**

### Mining
The process of validating and recording transactions on a blockchain network by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.

* * *

### Multisig Wallet
A type of cryptocurrency wallet that requires multiple keys to authorize a transaction, enhancing security.

* * *

## **N**

### Node
A connection point in a network, in blockchain typically a computer that connects to a blockchain network.

* * *

### Non-Fungible Token (NFT)
A type of cryptographic token on a blockchain that represents a unique asset or property.

* * *

## **O**

### Oracle
In blockchain, a way of bringing real-world data into a blockchain to interact with smart contracts.

* * *

## **P**

### Private Key
A secret number that allows a user to access their cryptocurrency funds, crucial for security in blockchain transactions.

* * *

### Proof of Stake (PoS)
A type of consensus algorithm in blockchain networks where the creator of a new block is chosen via various combinations of random selection and wealth or age.

* * *

## **Q**
