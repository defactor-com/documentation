# Frequently Asked Questions

## Common Questions

### Q1: How do I get started with Defactor development?

**A:** The API documentation is available [here](../category/back-end-api). It includes detailed descriptions of API endpoints, parameters, and examples.

### Q3: Why Blockchain?

**A:** A blockchain is a data registry that works as a large ledger of accounts shared between several users or "nodes" in which transactions are recorded in a reliable and secure way. In this ledger, "blocks" are recorded, which are collections of data. These blocks are connected to each other in a chronological way creating a kind of chain. For more details, see How does a blockchain work?

### Q4: How does a Smart Contract work?

**A:** A contract is simply a formalization agreement between two or more parties. It must define the scope, how to act and the consequences of acting in a different way. However, traditional contracts can present a problem: they are subject to interpretation.
