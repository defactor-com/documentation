# Frequently Asked Questions

## Common Questions

### Q1: How do I get started with Defactor development?

**A:** To get started, ensure you have the latest version of Defactor installed. Follow the setup instructions in our [Getting Started Guide](../blockchain-and-web3/index.md).

### Q2: Where can I find API documentation?

**A:** The API documentation is available [here](../category/back-end-services). It includes detailed descriptions of API endpoints, parameters, and examples.

### Q3: Why Blockchain?

**A:** A blockchain is a data registry that works as a large ledger of accounts shared between several users or "nodes" in which transactions are recorded in a reliable and secure way. In this ledger, "blocks" are recorded, which are collections of data. These blocks are connected to each other in a chronological way creating a kind of chain. For more details, see How does a blockchain work?

### Q4: What is the difference between a Regular Account and a Blockcahin Account?

**A:**
| Regular Account | Blockchain Account |  
|------|------|
|-Password is stored on company servers <br/> -Prone to be hack <br/> -No transparency | -Should be kept secret <br/> -Assymmetric crytography <br/> -Public key and private key <br/> -Different key pairs have different permissions asociated |

### Q5: How does a Smart Contract work?

**A:** A contract is simply a formalization agreement between two or more parties. It must define the scope, how to act and the consequences of acting in a different way. However, traditional contracts can present a problem: they are subject to interpretation. For more details on a smart contract, you can see [What is a smart contract?](https://eoscostarica.medium.com/qu%C3%A9-es-un-smart-contract-793d2042c65d)

### Q6: What is the difference between a public and private key?

**A:** They are part of the `Asymmetric Cipher`. Imagine a lock where the public key is used for closing the lock (encrypt the message) and the private key is used for opening the lock (decrypt the message).
Mentioned in Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman 1976 paper `New Directions in Cryptography`

> Public and private key definition can be found in the Tools, Glossary section.
