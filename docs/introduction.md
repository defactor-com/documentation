## Defactor's Role in Blockchain Ecosystem

Defactor plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and DeFi. By tokenizing real-world assets, it opens new avenues for investment, funding, and economic growth, while providing the security and efficiency of blockchain technology.

# Tokenized Real World Assets

Tokenized real-world assets refer to the representation of tangible or intangible assets as digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens reflect the value and ownership of their real-world counterparts, offering a bridge between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi).

## Advantages of Tokenization

- **Liquidity:** Tokenization can increase the liquidity of traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or art.
- **Accessibility:** Broadens the accessibility to investment opportunities, allowing fractional ownership.
- **Efficiency:** Streamlines processes, reducing the need for intermediaries and lowering transaction costs.
- **Transparency and Security:** Blockchain technology ensures transparent, secure, and tamper-proof record-keeping.
