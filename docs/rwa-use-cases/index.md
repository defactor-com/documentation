The following examples are provided to showcase the capabilities and the integration of the current Smart Contract across various use cases using the same contract.

As elucidated in this guide, Defactor furnishes three primary contracts, and the choice among them hinges on selecting the one that best aligns with the specific use case. While the default contract for the showcased examples, such as a Lease Agreement or Aurus, is the `ERC20CollateralPool` due to its adaptability and compatibility with any ERC20 token as collateral, it's worth noting that depending on specific requirements, any of the other two contracts can be chosen for optimal suitability.
