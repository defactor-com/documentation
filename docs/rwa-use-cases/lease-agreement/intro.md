This service digitizes the vehicle lease agreement process, enabling electronic interactions with the contract. It facilitates data entry, validation, storage, and retrieval of contract details, tailored for Angular front-end and Node.js backend with MongoDB.

## System Architecture

- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Cloud Hosting**: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, etc.)
- **API Documentation**: Swagger or OpenAPI

## Backend (Node.js with TypeScript)

### API Endpoints

- CRUD operations for lease agreements.
- Authentication and user management endpoints.
- Integration points for email/SMS services and other external APIs.

### Middleware

- Validation for data integrity.
- Authentication and authorization checks.
- Error handling.

### Database Integration

- Mongoose ODM for MongoDB integration.
- Schema definitions for contracts, users, vehicles, and payments.

### Security

- Implement OAuth 2.0 or JWT for secure API access.
- Hashing and salting of passwords.
- HTTPS for data encryption in transit.

### Logging and Monitoring

- Integration with logging frameworks like Winston or Morgan.
- AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and alerts.

## Frontend (Angular)

### User Interface

- Forms for entering and editing lease agreements.
- Dashboard for contract management and analytics.
- Responsive design for cross-platform compatibility.

### Data Binding and Management

- Reactive forms for dynamic user input.
- State management using services or NgRx.

### Client-Side Validation

- Form validation to ensure data integrity before submission.

### Integration with Backend

- HTTP client to interact with Node.js APIs.
- Handling of authentication tokens and secured routes.

## Database (MongoDB)

### Schema Design

- `User`, `Contract`, `Vehicle`, `Payment` collections.
- Indexing for performance optimization.

### Data Integrity

- Use of Mongoose for schema validation.
- Transactions for operations involving multiple documents.

## AWS Cloud Infrastructure

### Compute

- EC2 instances or Elastic Beanstalk for backend deployment.
- Load balancing and auto-scaling for high availability.

### Storage

- S3 for storing PDFs and other static assets.
- MongoDB Atlas for managed database service.

### Serverless Functions

- Lambda for running background tasks (e.g., reminders, notifications).

### Networking

- VPC setup for security.
- Route 53 for DNS management.

### CI/CD Pipeline

- AWS CodeBuild and CodePipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## Security Considerations

- AWS IAM roles and policies for fine-grained access control.
- Regular security audits and compliance with industry standards.
- Encryption of sensitive data using AWS KMS.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- Jest or Mocha for unit and integration testing.
- End-to-end testing with Protractor or a similar tool.
- Continuous integration via AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions.

## Documentation and Support

- Comprehensive API documentation using Swagger or OpenAPI.
- User guides for the frontend application.
- Developer guide for local setup and contribution.

## Future Enhancements
