Aurus introduces a groundbreaking solution for gold token holders, offering a digital representation of physical `GOLD`. This innovation allows holders to leverage tokenization benefits that are typically unattainable in the tangible world. By adopting the ERC20 token standard, the `GOLD` token provides ownership not just in entire gold ingots but in fractional amounts that collectively represent the ingot's total value. This digital representation empowers token holders to explore lending opportunities, a feat that would be challenging with physical gold.

Aurus Protocol facilitates borrowers in utilizing their gold fractions as collateral to secure loans. Given the unique nature of GOLD, which is not as divisible as traditional currencies, token holders can now access loans by using their `GOLD` as collateral within the Aurus pool. Each pool is initiated and funded by investors who take on the role of risk-takers, responsible for lending money to the pool. The protocol incorporates mechanisms to mitigate the risk of fund loss, and for every loan initiated from the pool, investors receive a percentage fee as a reward for their trust in the pool's objectives.
