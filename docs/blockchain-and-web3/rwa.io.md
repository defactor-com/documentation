RWA.IO is an Ethereum-compatible blockchain focused on the tokenization and management of Real World Assets (RWAs). Designed to bridge traditional finance with decentralized infrastructure, RWA.IO provides a secure, compliant, and scalable environment for issuing, trading, and managing digital representations of tangible assets such as real estate, commodities, bonds, and invoices.

### Key Features of RWA.IO

- **EVM Compatibility:** Built on standard Ethereum tooling, allowing seamless deployment of Solidity smart contracts.
- **Asset Tokenization:** Enables issuance and lifecycle management of tokenized RWAs with built-in compliance layers.
- **Regulatory Alignment:** Designed with a focus on KYC/AML, governance, and auditability for institutional use.
- **Interoperability:** Connects with Ethereum-native tools and protocols via bridges and standard APIs.

### RWA.IO's Role in Enhancing Ethereum

RWA.IO complements Ethereum by bringing real-world financial instruments on-chain in a secure and regulated manner. It enables the tokenization of off-chain assets while maintaining smart contract programmability and blockchain transparency. By offloading specific regulated use cases from Ethereum to a dedicated network, RWA.IO contributes to the broader Web3 adoption and real-world integration.

## RWA.IO Wallets

Wallets are essential for interacting with the RWA.IO network. They enable users to store, transfer, and interact with tokenized assets through smart contracts and compliant applications.

### Types of RWA.IO Wallets

- **Software Wallets:** Browser extensions like MetaMask or Rabby allow users to connect to RWA.IO using custom RPCs.
- **Hardware Wallets:** Devices like Ledger and Trezor offer secure storage for private keys and tokenized assets.
- **Web Wallets:** Interfaces provided by integrated platforms or custodians for asset management and onboarding.
- **Mobile Wallets:** Wallet apps supporting custom EVM networks, enabling access to RWA.IO on mobile.

### Popular RWA.IO Wallet: MetaMask

MetaMask is fully compatible with RWA.IO through manual network configuration. Users can interact with RWA.IO's smart contracts and tokenized assets by connecting to the network's RPC and chain ID, available in the official documentation.

## Understanding RWA.IO Gas Fees

RWA.IO uses gas fees to compensate validators for executing smart contracts and processing transactions. Its network is optimized for performance and cost-efficiency, supporting enterprise-grade use cases and frequent asset movements.

### Factors Affecting Gas Fees on RWA.IO

- **Transaction Complexity:** Tokenization, transfers, and compliance checks may involve multiple steps.
- **Network Usage:** Higher activity could increase gas prices temporarily.
- **Fee Customization:** Governance-based configurations allow network-specific fee strategies.

## RWA.IO Test Environment

RWA.IO provides an active and maintained testnet environment to simulate asset tokenization workflows before mainnet deployment. It is built using the same architecture as the mainnet and supports all EVM tools.

### Features of RWA.IO Test Environment

- **Full EVM Compatibility:** Supports Solidity, Hardhat, Remix, and Foundry.
- **Safe Testing for RWAs:** Developers can simulate real-world asset lifecycle events in a controlled environment.
- **Faucet Access:** Test tokens are available through official tools for development and QA workflows.
- **Stable and Maintained:** Continuously updated to mirror production logic and security.

### Accessing the RWA.IO Test Environment

To access the RWA.IO testnet, developers can configure supported wallets using the network’s RPC, chain ID, and faucet, all available through the RWA.IO developer portal. This ensures a smooth transition between testing and production environments.
