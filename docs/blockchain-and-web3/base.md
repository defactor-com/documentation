Base is an Ethereum Layer 2 network built by Coinbase using the Optimism OP Stack. It is designed to provide a secure, scalable, and low-cost environment for decentralized applications (DApps) while maintaining full compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. As part of the broader Ethereum scaling roadmap, Base contributes to a modular, multi-chain internet by extending Ethereum’s capabilities with faster and cheaper transactions.

### Key Features of Base

- **Scalability:** Base significantly reduces transaction costs and increases throughput by leveraging optimistic rollup technology.
- **Ethereum Compatibility:** Full EVM compatibility allows seamless integration with Ethereum tools, smart contracts, and DApps.
- **Developer Support:** Built and maintained by Coinbase, with robust tooling and infrastructure to support developers.
- **Security:** Inherits Ethereum’s security guarantees through rollup design and decentralized validation.

### Base's Role in Enhancing Ethereum

Base supports Ethereum’s vision by addressing core limitations such as high gas fees and limited transaction capacity. By operating as a Layer 2 rollup, it ensures that users and developers benefit from fast finality and low-cost interactions, without compromising on decentralization or security. Base plays an essential role in onboarding the next billion users to Ethereum through Coinbase’s ecosystem.

## Base Wallets

Wallets are critical for interacting with the Base network. They allow users to manage accounts, sign transactions, and access applications deployed on Base.

### Types of Base Wallets

- **Software Wallets:** Desktop or browser-based wallets offering balance between usability and security.
- **Hardware Wallets:** Physical wallets providing the highest level of key protection.
- **Web Wallets:** Browser-accessible interfaces for quick and simple usage.
- **Mobile Wallets:** Applications for managing accounts directly from mobile devices.

### Popular Base Wallet: MetaMask

MetaMask, one of the most widely-used Ethereum wallets, can be easily configured to support Base. Users can add Base’s network details manually or through services like Chainlist, allowing them to manage assets and interact with Base-based applications seamlessly.

## Understanding Base Gas Fees

Like other Ethereum Layer 2 networks, Base uses gas fees to cover the computational effort required to process and secure transactions. However, these fees are significantly lower compared to Ethereum mainnet, making Base attractive for developers and users alike.

### Factors Affecting Gas Fees on Base

- **Network Activity:** Fees may vary depending on the demand and throughput.
- **Transaction Type:** More complex smart contracts consume more gas.
- **Gas Price:** Set by users and determines how quickly transactions are confirmed.

## Base Testnets: Base Sepolia

Base Sepolia is the official testnet used for building and testing applications before deploying on the Base mainnet. It mirrors the behavior of the mainnet and provides developers with a reliable environment for experimentation.

### Features of Base Sepolia Testnet

- **Ethereum-Compatible:** Functions similarly to Ethereum’s Sepolia testnet with full EVM support.
- **Coinbase-Backed Infrastructure:** Ensures strong uptime and reliability.
- **Test ETH Access:** Developers can request test ETH through official faucets for simulated transactions.
- **Pre-Mainnet Testing:** Enables accurate testing of apps, contracts, and interactions before live deployment.

### Accessing the Base Sepolia Testnet

To access Base Sepolia, developers can use wallets like MetaMask and connect using the appropriate RPC configuration. Test ETH can be obtained from the official Coinbase faucet or community-supported faucets, enabling realistic development and deployment cycles.
