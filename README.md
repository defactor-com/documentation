# Defactor Developer Documentation

This website is published on [defactor.dev](https://defactor.dev) as technical documentation for defactor developers. The website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- Yarn (v1.22.0 or higher)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/defactor-com/documentation.git
cd documentation
yarn install
```

### Local Development

```sh
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```sh
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

We  are using GitHub pages for hosting, changes mergred to the `main` branch will automatically build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
